Quick little recreation of the google home page

This is the first project I worked on when starting my HTML & CSS journey! This was a very fun project that definintely took me a couple hours while learning the basics and fundamentals of both HTML and CSS throughout the tutorial posted by SmolJames.
This project is part of a many part series on learning to become a software engineer and is just the beginning!
Hope to see visible improvement over my next few projects and cant wait to share everything!
